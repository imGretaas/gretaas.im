# gretaas.im
Personal Website

Italy, 06/07/19

This is the code created for my personal website.
I created it using the editor Sublime Text, with the rules that I learned during Web Technology's course at my University and after the creation of a University Project.
It's easy and basical; I created a static page with the essential element of HTML language (like paragraph, div, class, id, title and lists) and I implemented the style of page with CSS's rules.
It's responsive; I used, mainly, text.

If you want, you can check it googling/following this address link: https://gretaas.im 

Thanks!
