Personal Website

Italy, 06/07/19

This is the code created for my personal website.
I created it using the editor Sublime Text, with the rules that i learned during Web Technology's course at my University and after the creation of a University Project.
It's easy and basical; i created a static page with the essential element of HTML (like paragraph, div, class, id, title and lists) language and i implemented the style of page with CSS's rules.
It's responsive; i used, mainly, text.
